#100-Days-Of-Code Challenge 2.0 version (START: 14 January 2026)
{100 Days Of Code Challenge Round 2 with new me.}
My Quote: "Something is better than nothing at all." =)

Day 0/100 : 14 January 2026, Wednesday (≈25 mins ; <1 hour❌)
> What do I do today :
- Honestly, I still procrastinate to program & learn Python even though my free time is so limited. But yeah the second best time is "now" realistically, we can't change the past.
- I'm taking the 100 Days-Of-Code Challenge for the second round starting today 14 January 2026, Wednesday.

- IMPORTANT: I committed to at least every day, programming Python for 25 mins every day for completing the 100 Days-Of-Code Challenge for the second round 14 January 2026 as a new me. (to fit 25/5 Pomodoro, actually)

- Still working on Lecture 149 Day 20 challenge Udemy Dr. Angela Yu. I have no idea =)
- I feel so sleepy and exhausted right now due to procrastination. The second-best time is NOW.
- HAPPY LEARNING!!!
- HAPPY CODING!!!

Day 1/100 : 15 January 2026, Thursday (≈30 mins ; <1 hour❌)
> What do I do today :
- Finally I understand OOP, particularly def init(self, param1, param2): in Python "hopefully" hehehehe. It is really challenging for me to understand that concept.
- Finished Lecture 149 Day 20 Challenge and understand Dr. Angela's solution to solve the challenge.
- Just starting Lecture 150 Day 20 Challenge; still working on The Snake Game Project day 1
- I feel so sleepy and tired right now due to my busy schedule of school and homework today. Sleeping 8 hours is crucial, guys.
- HAPPY LEARNING!!!
- HAPPY CODING!!!

Day 2/100 : 16 January 2026, Friday (≈30 mins ; <1 hour❌)
> What do I do today :
- Solved Lecture 150 Day 20 Challenge by myself fairly easily, creating snake body control WASD inside the SnakeBody class. I understand & applied the OOP concept.
- Finally completed Day 20 of the course Udemy, creating half of The Snake Game Project (day 1).
- Just starting out Day 21 of the course. Learned about OOP inheritance (watching Lecture 153).
- Today I am having a family gathering (quality time). =)
- HAPPY LEARNING!!!
- HAPPY CODING!!!

Day 3/100 : 17 January 2026, Saturday (≈140 mins ; >1 hour✅)
> What do I do today :
- Applied inheritance OOP theory to complete The Snake Game Project, day 2 inside Day 21 of the course.
- Finally finished Day 21 of the course by creating The Snake Game using Turtle and OOP. It is a really challenging project I have tackled so far.
- I have written all crucial comments for each "important" component inside The Snake Game Project day 2 to improve maintainability, reliability, and make it more readable, at least for my future self hehehehe. =)
- Finally, I truly understand OOP concepts and how to apply them in Python. It is a really challenging intermediate concept for me so far.
- I am trying to make a habit of writing several comments for each crucial component, especially for complex projects in the future. More frequently using OOP Python.
- Stay consistent with at least a single session of 25/5 Pomodoro for me.
- HAPPY LEARNING!!!
- HAPPY CODING!!!
