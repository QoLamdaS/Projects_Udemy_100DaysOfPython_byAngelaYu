#100-Days-Of-Code Challenge 2.0 version (START: 14 January 2026)
{100 Days Of Code Challenge Round 2 with new me.}
My Quote: "Something is better than nothing at all." =)

Day 0/100 : 14 January 2026, Wednesday (≈25 mins ; <1 hour❌)
> What do I do today :
- Honestly, I still procrastinate to program & learn Python even though my free time is so limited. But yeah the second best time is "now" realistically, we can't change the past.
- I'm taking the 100 Days-Of-Code Challenge for the second round starting today 14 January 2026, Wednesday.

- IMPORTANT: I committed to at least every day, programming Python for 25 mins every day for completing the 100 Days-Of-Code Challenge for the second round 14 January 2026 as a new me. (to fit 25/5 Pomodoro, actually)

- Still working on Lecture 149 Day 20 challenge Udemy Dr. Angela Yu. I have no idea =)
- I feel so sleepy and exhausted right now due to procrastination. The second-best time is NOW.
- HAPPY LEARNING!!!
- HAPPY CODING!!!
