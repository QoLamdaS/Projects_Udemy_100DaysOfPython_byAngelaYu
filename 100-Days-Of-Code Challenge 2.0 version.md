#100-Days-Of-Code Challenge 2.0 version (START: 14 January 2026)
{100 Days Of Code Challenge Round 2 with new me.}
My Quote: "Something is better than nothing at all." =)

Day 0/100 : 14 January 2026, Wednesday (≈25 mins ; <1 hour❌)
> What do I do today :
- Honestly, I still procrastinate to program & learn Python even though my free time is so limited. But yeah the second best time is "now" realistically, we can't change the past.
- I'm taking the 100 Days-Of-Code Challenge for the second round starting today 14 January 2026, Wednesday.

- IMPORTANT: I committed to at least every day, programming Python for 25 mins every day for completing the 100 Days-Of-Code Challenge for the second round 14 January 2026 as a new me. (to fit 25/5 Pomodoro, actually)

- Still working on Lecture 149 Day 20 challenge Udemy Dr. Angela Yu. I have no idea =)
- I feel so sleepy and exhausted right now due to procrastination. The second-best time is NOW.
- HAPPY LEARNING!!!
- HAPPY CODING!!!

Day 1/100 : 15 January 2026, Thursday (≈30 mins ; <1 hour❌)
> What do I do today :
- Finally I understand OOP, particularly def init(self, param1, param2): in Python "hopefully" hehehehe. It is really challenging for me to understand that concept.
- Finished Lecture 149 Day 20 Challenge and understand Dr. Angela's solution to solve the challenge.
- Just starting Lecture 150 Day 20 Challenge; still working on The Snake Game Project day 1
- I feel so sleepy and tired right now due to my busy schedule of school and homework today. Sleeping 8 hours is crucial, guys.
- HAPPY LEARNING!!!
- HAPPY CODING!!!

Day 2/100 : 16 January 2026, Friday (≈30 mins ; <1 hour❌)
> What do I do today :
- Solved Lecture 150 Day 20 Challenge by myself fairly easily, creating snake body control WASD inside the SnakeBody class. I understand & applied the OOP concept.
- Finally completed Day 20 of the course Udemy, creating half of The Snake Game Project (day 1).
- Just starting out Day 21 of the course. Learned about OOP inheritance (watching Lecture 153).
- Today I am having a family gathering (quality time). =)
- HAPPY LEARNING!!!
- HAPPY CODING!!!

Day 3/100 : 17 January 2026, Saturday (≈140 mins ; >1 hour✅)
> What do I do today :
- Applied inheritance OOP theory to complete The Snake Game Project, day 2 inside Day 21 of the course.
- Finally finished Day 21 of the course by creating The Snake Game using Turtle and OOP. It is a really challenging project I have tackled so far.
- I have written all crucial comments for each "important" component inside The Snake Game Project day 2 to improve maintainability, reliability, and make it more readable, at least for my future self hehehehe. =)
- Finally, I truly understand OOP concepts and how to apply them in Python. It is a really challenging intermediate concept for me so far.
- I am trying to make a habit of writing several comments for each crucial component, especially for complex projects in the future. More frequently using OOP Python.
- Stay consistent with at least a single session of 25/5 Pomodoro for me.
- HAPPY LEARNING!!!
- HAPPY CODING!!!

Day 4/100 : 18 January 2026, Sunday (≈90 mins ; >1 hour✅)
> What do I do today :
- Start to work on creating The Pong Arcade Game Project (1,8 solved by myself over the 9 pieces of the problems in Lecture 160 Day 22 to complete Day 22 project)
- I am challenging myself in Lecture 160 Day 22 to create The Pong Arcade Game Project from almost scratch by myself without watching/peeking Dr. Angela Yu's codings/solutions.
- Wish me luck guys, to tackle this challenge by myself! =)
- Solved the first piece of the 9 main problems, creating the default fullscreen black.
- Almost solved the second piece, creating user_left and user_right paddles as default objects born, and user controls (up & down), and then having several tests. However, CRUCIAL BUG: Cannot holding keypresses for left & right paddles simultaneously. I have no idea how to fix that bug hehehe =)
- Honestly, it is one of the most challenging & demanding projects that I have ever worked on so far. Also, it requires extensive OOP concepts to apply for efficiency and maintainability.
- I procrastinated a bit doing programming, which is a very common human experience hehehehe =)
- STAY CONSISTENT at least for a single session of 25/5 Pomodoro for me.
- HAPPY LEARNING!!!
- HAPPY CODING!!!

Day 5/100 : 19 January 2026, Monday (≈10 mins ; <1 hour❌)
> What do I do today :

- I feel very exhausted and sleepy now.
- Please "returning/back to minimum duration" tomorrow to STAY CONSISTENT at least for a single session of 25/5 Pomodoro for me.
- HAPPY LEARNING!

Day 6/100 : 20 January 2026, Tuesday (≈25 mins ; <1 hour❌)
> What do I do today :
- I am still trying to solve cannot being able to hold keypresses for left and right paddles simultaneously for Day 22 Project (In-Challenge without watching Dr. Angela's guides), "The Pong Arcade Game Project".
- Right now, I feel so exhausted and sleepy due to insufficient sleep.
- I am programming a bit ineffectively/inefficiently due to insufficient sleep and am so exhausted.
- Stay Consistent at least for a single session of 25/5 Pomodoro for me.

> What do I do today :
- Today I'm really so busy (REAL) finishing my school group project ["Important maybe and urgent"]
- Still trying to solve, cannot holding keypresses for left and right paddles simultaneously for Day 22 Project (In-Challenge without watching Dr. Angela's guides) "The Pong Arcade Game Project". I have no idea.

Day 8/100 : 22 January 2026, Wednesday (≈35 mins ; <1 hour❌)
> What do I do today :
- Today I'm busy studying for my school exams tomorrow.
- I solved "cannot holding keypresses for left and right paddles simultaneously" for Day 22 Project (still In-Challenge without watching Dr. Angela's guides so far) by deleting the problem/bug. I "give up" for 'over-engineering'. It's so time-consuming and has no significant development for "The Pong Arcade Game Project" so far. =)
- I feel so tired and sleepy. I have no idea.
- Stay Consistent at least for a single session of 25/5 Pomodoro for me.
- Happy Coding!

> What do I do today :
- Today I'm swamped/busy studying for my upcoming exam period and doing homework.
- Also, I don't know why I feel so lazy and unmotivated to code. Maybe because I'm exhausted or just unlucky =)
- I finally decided to follow Dr. Angela's recommendation to watch her codings (Lecture 160 Day 22). I "give up" taking the challenge "The Pong Arcade Game Project" without watching Dr. Angela's codings/solutions.
- My reasons: It is time-consuming (multiple days to complete), and I have other priorities to focus on, such as homework and the upcoming exam period.
- I am trying to solve Lecture 164 Day 22 Challenge, creating the ball class for The Pong Arcade Game Project.
- Stay Consistent at least for a single session of 25/5 Pomodoro for me.
- HAPPY LEARNING!!!

- HAPPY LEARNING!

> What do I do today :
- Almost solved Lecture 165 Day 22 adding ball bouncing logic after hitting the up & down wall. I don't know why the ball can't bounce even though the code is still same. I have no idea.
- I'm still busy completing my homework and studying for my exams tomorrow. 
- Still consistent programming for at least 25 minutes every day.
- Happy Coding!

Day 12/100 : 26 January 2026, Monday (≈25 mins ; <1 hour❌)
> What do I do today :
- Solved Lecture 165 Day 22, adding ball bouncing logic after hitting the up & down wall.
- Solved Lecture 166 Day 22, adding detection of collisions with user paddles.
- I don't know why I feel lazy about programming today. Maybe because I'm busy and tired studying for my exams tomorrow.
- Stay consistent with programming for at least 25 minutes every day.
- Happy Learning!

Day 13/100 : 27 January 2026, Tuesday (≈25 mins ; <1 hour❌)
> What do I do today :
- Solved Lecture 167 Day 22 Challenge by myself, adding to detect the ball goes out of range x_coordinates correctly. Weirdly, my ball "froze" in Python Turtle Terminal even though my code is clearly correct. I think it is IDE/laptop bugs??
- I feel tired of programming and a bit unmotivated. I don't know why.
- Stay consistent with programming for at least 25 minutes every day.
- Happy Learning!

Day 14/100 : 28 January 2026, Wednesday (≈10 mins ; <1 hour❌)
