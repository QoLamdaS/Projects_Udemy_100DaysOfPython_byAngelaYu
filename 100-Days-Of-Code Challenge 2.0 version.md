{100 Days Of Code Challenge Round 2 with new me.}
My Quote: "Something is better than nothing at all." =)

Day 0/100 : 14 January 2026, Wednesday (≈25 mins ; <1 hour❌)
> What do I do today :
- Honestly, I still procrastinate to program & learn Python even though my free time is so limited. But yeah the second best time is "now" realistically, we can't change the past.
- I'm taking the 100 Days-Of-Code Challenge for the second round starting today 14 January 2026, Wednesday.

- IMPORTANT: I committed to at least every day, programming Python for 25 mins every day for completing the 100 Days-Of-Code Challenge for the second round 14 January 2026 as a new me. (to fit 25/5 Pomodoro, actually)

- Still working on Lecture 149 Day 20 challenge Udemy Dr. Angela Yu. I have no idea =)
- I feel so sleepy and exhausted right now due to procrastination. The second-best time is NOW.
- HAPPY LEARNING!!!
- HAPPY CODING!!!

Day 1/100 : 15 January 2026, Thursday (≈30 mins ; <1 hour❌)
> What do I do today :
- Finally I understand OOP, particularly def init(self, param1, param2): in Python "hopefully" hehehehe. It is really challenging for me to understand that concept.
- Finished Lecture 149 Day 20 Challenge and understand Dr. Angela's solution to solve the challenge.
- Just starting Lecture 150 Day 20 Challenge; still working on The Snake Game Project day 1
- I feel so sleepy and tired right now due to my busy schedule of school and homework today. Sleeping 8 hours is crucial, guys.
- HAPPY LEARNING!!!
- HAPPY CODING!!!
